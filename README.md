# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C.

## How to Play
- Player X and Player O take turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid.
- The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or if the grid is full.

## Instructions
1. Compile the code with `make`.
2. Run the game using `./tic_tac_toe`.
3. Enter row and column numbers (0-2) to place your mark.
